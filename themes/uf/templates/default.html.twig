            Chances are you're here because you have a great idea for a user-oriented website.

            Whether it's a private forum for your WoW guild, an employee management system for your small business, or the next big social network, we're guessing you want to get started on your awesome new idea as quickly as possible. You most certainly do not want to spend your time writing code to manage user authentication and authorization.

            Userfrosting delivers.
        </p>
        <h3>
            <img src="{{ url('theme://images/cupcake.svg') }}">
            Get started, without starting from "Hello World".
        </h3> 
        <p class="flow-text">
             With some basic configuration and an easy-to-use installer, you'll be ready to create and manage user accounts in 5 minutes or less. All you need is a web server running PHP 5.4 or greater, and a SQL database.
             
             Who is UserFrosting meant for?
             UserFrosting is meant for individuals who have some background in programming, but are not familiar with all of the modern tools available to make development in PHP faster, and to make your code better structured and easier to manage. By starting with UserFrosting, you will be comfortably introduced to Composer (the dependency manager), MVC, the front-controller pattern, and RESTful URLs.
