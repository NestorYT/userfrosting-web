        <ul>
            <li>
                If you're just getting started with UserFrosting and the code looks completely different from anything you've ever seen before, we recommend that you start with <a href="http://www.userfrosting.com/navigating/">Navigating UserFrosting</a>.  This will explain the components and practices that UserFrosting uses to do its magic.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're having trouble with installation, please see our <a href="http://www.userfrosting.com/troubleshooting">troubleshooting guide</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you feel comfortable with the basic concepts, and were able to install UserFrosting successfully, you can dive into the code with our <a href="http://www.userfrosting.com/tutorials">tutorials</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have a problem that you've already tried to solve and you can ask a specific, focused question, consider asking on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.  Include the relevant code, and any errors reported in your PHP error log and/or browser console.  Tag your question with the <code>userfrosting</code> tag, and optionally with any tags specific to the relevant underlying technologies, such as <code>slim</code>, <code>twig</code>, <code>eloquent</code>, <code>composer</code>, etc.  You should also mention the version of UserFrosting that you are using.
            </li>
            <li>
                After posting a question on Stack Overflow, please link to it our <a href="https://chat.userfrosting.com/channel/support">chat room</a>.  This will ensure that more people see it, and provide a place where we can discuss and help clarify your question.

            Tips for asking for help
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Remember that courtesy and proper grammar go a long way. Please take the time to craft a <strong>precise, polite question</strong>. We will do our best to help, but remember that this is an open source project - none of us are getting paid a salary to develop this project, or act as your personal support hotline ;-)
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully search <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/userfrosting">Stack Overflow</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue">Github issue tracker</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/wiki">wiki</a>.  Your question may have already been asked and answered before!
            </li>
            <li>
                Report any error messages you get. There are two main places where you may find error messages:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Backend (PHP-related) errors: in your PHP error log. This is usually a file called <code>php_error_log</code> or something like that. In XAMPP, the default location of this file is <code>XAMPP/xamppfiles/logs/</code>. For other web hosting platforms, please consult the documentation or do a quick Google search (i.e. "where is the php error log in _____"). Some web hosts may provide a special interface for accessing the php error log, through ssh, cpanel, etc. Please ask them directly for help with this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Frontend (Javascript-related) errors: in your browser's Javascript console. This can be accessed from "Tools->Web Developer" menu in Firefox, or "More tools->Javascript Console" in Chrome. For help with other browsers, please Google "where is the javascript console in ____".
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                If you find a problem in any of the tutorials, let us know on the Issues page. Also, please feel free to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/wiki">wiki</a> if you have something relevant and useful to add.
