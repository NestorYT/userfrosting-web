            UserFrosting is a web framework.  Like other web frameworks, it offers a complete toolbox of programmatic components for building your application.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            Unlike other frameworks, however, it _is_ a fully-functioning user management application, right out of the box.  All you need to do is extend it with the specific features you need.

            UserFrosting is designed to bring new and returning developers up to speed with the modern PHP community.  You'll be comfortably introduced to Composer (the dependency manager), object-oriented design patterns, and the PHP Standards Recommendations (PSR), making your code better structured and easier to manage.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            What's more, you'll learn how to use Node.js and Bower to cleanly manage client-side packages (Javascript and CSS).  Transform yourself from a code monkey into a software engineer.

            Using the documentation
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you're just getting started with UserFrosting and the code looks completely different from anything you've ever seen before, we recommend that you start with <a href="http://www.userfrosting.com/navigating/">Navigating UserFrosting</a>.  This will explain the components and practices that UserFrosting uses to do its magic.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're having trouble with installation, please see our <a href="http://www.userfrosting.com/troubleshooting">troubleshooting guide</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you feel comfortable with the basic concepts, and were able to install UserFrosting successfully, you can dive into the code with our <a href="http://www.userfrosting.com/tutorials">tutorials</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have a problem that you've already tried to solve and you can ask a specific, focused question, consider asking on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.  Include the relevant code, and any errors reported in your PHP error log and/or browser console.  Tag your question with the <code>userfrosting</code> tag, and optionally with any tags specific to the relevant underlying technologies, such as <code>slim</code>, <code>twig</code>, <code>eloquent</code>, <code>composer</code>, etc.  You should also mention the version of UserFrosting that you are using.
            </li>
            <li>
                After posting a question on Stack Overflow, please link to it our <a href="https://chat.userfrosting.com/channel/support">chat room</a>.  This will ensure that more people see it, and provide a place where we can discuss and help clarify your question.

            Tips for asking for help
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Remember that courtesy and proper grammar go a long way. Please take the time to craft a <strong>precise, polite question</strong>. We will do our best to help, but remember that this is an open source project - none of us are getting paid a salary to develop this project, or act as your personal support hotline ;-)
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully search <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/userfrosting">Stack Overflow</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue">Github issue tracker</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/wiki">wiki</a>.  Your question may have already been asked and answered before!
            </li>
            <li>
                Report any error messages you get. There are two main places where you may find error messages:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Backend (PHP-related) errors: in your PHP error log. This is usually a file called <code>php_error_log</code> or something like that. In XAMPP, the default location of this file is <code>XAMPP/xamppfiles/logs/</code>. For other web hosting platforms, please consult the documentation or do a quick Google search (i.e. "where is the php error log in _____"). Some web hosts may provide a special interface for accessing the php error log, through ssh, cpanel, etc. Please ask them directly for help with this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Frontend (Javascript-related) errors: in your browser's Javascript console. This can be accessed from "Tools->Web Developer" menu in Firefox, or "More tools->Javascript Console" in Chrome. For help with other browsers, please Google "where is the javascript console in ____".
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                If you find a problem in any of the tutorials, let us know on the Issues page. Also, please feel free to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/wiki">wiki</a> if you have something relevant and useful to add.
            </li>
