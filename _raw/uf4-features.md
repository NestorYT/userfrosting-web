# Developer Features

## Modern specs
90's fashion might be back in style, but 90's development practices are not.  Our detailed installation guide painlessly introduces you to the modern developer's toolkit.

## Fully extendable
New in version 4, the Sprinkle system lets you implement your application without ever modifying UF's core codebase.  Sprinkles can also be used to implement themes, plugins and more - see what our community has to offer!

## Clean separation of concerns
No spaghetti code in here!  Give the gift of maintainability to your future self.  

## Exhaustive documentation
Clear, jargon-free guides for every aspect of the framework.  More than just the "how" and "what" - we explain the "why", too.

## Optimization
Just about every component can be optimized for production.  Define and compile asset bundles with Node.js, leverage caching for template rendering and route resolution, or use Laravel's caching service to cache arbitrary resources.  All of this is automatically supported by UF's core!

## Eloquent ORM
Stop writing tedious queries for basic database operations.  Spin simple one-liners with Laravel's active record implementation, Eloquent.

## Internationalization
UserFrosting supports sophisticated pluralization rules and nested subkeys for seamless multi-language applications.

## Request throttling
The throttler lets you define custom rules for limiting request rates by IP or username.  Protect your company from the risk of DOS and bruteforce attacks.

## Data request APIs
Easily implement sortable, searchable, paginated JSON APIs for your data collections with our customizable Sprunje system.

## Fortress
Fortress unified interface for data validation and transformation.  Validate user input on both client- and server-side with a single JSON schema!

## Error handling
Throw an exception, then use a custom exception handler to send detailed error information to logs and/or present a useful message for users.

## Logging
UserFrosting uses Monolog, which can send detailed logging information to the database, log files, or even to email!
