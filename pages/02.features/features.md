# Developer Features
## What developer features are

### Installation guide and tool
90's fashion might be back in style, but 90's development practices are not.  Our detailed installation guide painlessly introduces you to the modern developer's toolkit.

### Fully extendable
New in version 4, the Sprinkle system lets you implement your application without ever modifying UF's core codebase.  Sprinkles can also be used to implement themes, plugins and more - see what our community has to offer!

### Clean separation of concerns
No spaghetti code in here!  Give the gift of maintainability to your future self.
Twig for templating, Slim for routing your endpoints to controller classes, and Pimple to provide a convenient container for your service classes.  

### Exhaustive documentation
Clear, jargon-free guides for every aspect of the framework.  More than just the "how" and "what" - we explain the "why", too.

### Optimization
Just about every component can be optimized for production.  Define and compile asset bundles with Node.js, leverage caching for template rendering and route resolution, or use Laravel's caching service to cache arbitrary resources.  All of this is automatically supported by UF's core!

### Eloquent ORM
Don't waste any more time writing database queries_

### Internationalization
_Support for multi-language applications_

### Request throttling
_Limit request rates to mitigate DOS and bruteforce attacks_

### Fortress
_A unified interface for data validation and transformation._

Specify rules for client- and server-side validation in a single JSON schema!
